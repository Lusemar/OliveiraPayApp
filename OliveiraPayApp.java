Programming Assignment #3: Payroll Application
Due date: Friday, January 29, 2021
Program Description: Write a program that reads the following information and prints a payroll statement with
Employeeâ€™s name (e.g. John Doe),Number of hours worked in a week (e.g. 40) Hourly pay rate (e.g. 15.50)
Federal tax withholding rate (e.g. 15%), State tax withholding rate (e.g. 5%) and then print all user entered information
and in addition the gross pay, fed withholding dollar amount, state withholding dollar amount, total deductions, and net pay.
